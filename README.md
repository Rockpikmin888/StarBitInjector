# StarBitInjector
StarBitInjector V0.1 (Working on Kernel Features, may take some time however)
This is a C# project that injects a dll into a process utilizing IntPtrs.
This program gets all currently running processes and adds them to a directory.
If this works, the console spits out all the processes and their correlating numbers.
To inject into a process, type the number beside the name (example: application), then type the dll name that you want to inject (example: test.dll).
Make sure your DLL is on your desktop.
This injector also has some checks for security as well as a version check.
If you have any security concerns or any issues, please contact my discord: rockpikmin888#8888.
